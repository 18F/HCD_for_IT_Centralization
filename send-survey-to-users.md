# 5. Send an open-ended survey to users 
Qualitative surveys are good for generating precise feedback because participants can describe things qualitatively rather than just answering “yes” or “no”. You can easily set up a survey like this on [Google Forms.](https://www.google.com/forms/about/)

Here are a few sample questions to send out to a larger group of users - those who can’t be in person for the brainstorm exercises. You can fill in the blanks below with the IT service or tool you want to learn more about. 

## Open-ended questions

- 1. With the last ___ you worked on in mind, which technical services or tools helped you get your work done? (Examples: remote access, ALS software, email, service desk, trainings) 

- 2. With the last ___ you worked on in mind, what technical obstacles stood in the way of getting your work done? (Ex: network problems, computer issues, software issues, service outages, communication issues) 

- 3. If you had a magic assistant that could help you with any of your tasks or obstacles, what would it do?

Once you receive responses, generate a detailed list of the services this group uses most, what kinds of technical obstacles get in the way of their work, and how they might be improved.
