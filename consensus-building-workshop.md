Facilitate a consensus-building workshop

This is a great opportunity to bring together stakeholders from different components of the agency. Be sure to include folks from IT, security, operations, developers, and other people who actually use the service and will be affected by the centralization initiative. The goal of this workshop is to learn more about the current IT landscape across different agency components. 

Some areas to focus on: 
- What are the existing IT services?
- How are different agency components currently using these services?
- How are these services working for them (good or bad)? 

This will help you verify existing data and collect new data to inform subsequent conversations. With all the IT services that an agency provides, itâ€™s important to narrow down on the scope early in the process.
