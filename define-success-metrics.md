#8. Define success metrics

How will you know if your efforts are successful or unsuccessful? Hopefully your organization already has Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) you can measure against. Make sure your KPIs include outcomes you want to achieve for users, not just outcomes that focus on the bottom line. 

A couple examples of strong KPIs might be: 

- _A contracting officer can use this system to write a contract 5% faster than on the current system._
- _A contracting officer will be able to use this system to write a contract in the same amount of time as the current system, but it will cost 5% less._

Create meaningful metrics to measure the impact you hope to have. These metrics will help track the progress of your project, measure vendor performance, and understand if your efforts are having the impact you hoped for. 

**Pro-tip:** If you’re not already measuring a service, make sure you know how you can get to the data. Unmeasurable metrics aren’t very helpful to anyone.
