# Project overview 
How might federal agencies design centralized IT services to produce value for teams rather than burden them? This question is at the heart of this 10x phase 2 project.

We’ve synthesized outcomes from past 18F consulting engagements to share ways in which human-centered design methods can mitigate risks associated with centralizing IT services. We’ve analyzed real scenarios in which agency partners have attempted centralization but they didn’t always work out as hoped. We’ve talked to users who understand how centralization has impacted their day-to-day work. We’ve collected many insights about how this plays out, and have distilled our learnings into this content series to highlight best practices.

# Why this content matters
Hundreds of millions of dollars are spent on centralization efforts that don't end up delivering value to users. Many guides on centralization focus on IT as an ends not the means to achieve an agency’s mission. This often results in expensive vendor contracts that eventually get tossed out the window a few years later. We believe approaching centralization in a user-centered way reduces risks and improves outcomes for IT leaders, their employees, and the citizens they serve.

# Intended audience
Our intended audience is CIOs who set their agency’s modernization strategies as well as performance managers or others who make decisions around IT centralization efforts within an agency. Our goal is to introduce this audience to user-centered exercises, methods, and other advice to guide them through the process with their teams. 

# Human-centered design for IT centralization content series
We’ve created a multi-part content series/guide that includes materials on the following: 
- [Defining IT centralization](https://github.com/18F/HCD_for_IT_Centralization/blob/master/deciding_whether_or_not_to_centralize.md)
- [Deciding whether or not to centralize](https://github.com/18F/HCD_for_IT_Centralization/blob/master/defining_IT_centralization.md) 
- [Working with vendors to build a centralized solution](https://github.com/18F/HCD_for_IT_Centralization/blob/master/working_with_vendors_to_build_a_centralized_solution.md)
- [What happens after you centralize](https://github.com/18F/HCD_for_IT_Centralization/blob/master/what_happens_after_you_centralize.md)
- [Centralization gone right: a case study on the U.S. Web Design System](https://github.com/18F/HCD_for_IT_Centralization/blob/master/case_study_USWDS.md)

# Applicable user design exercies
Digging into user research early in this process will mitigate much bigger risks down the line. Below are some exerices we recommend agencies run through with their teams when evaluating IT centralization.
