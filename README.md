# Project overview 
How might federal agencies evaluate IT centralization with a user-centered approach? Why is it important to do so? How will this approach bring value to the agency? These questions are at the heart of this [10x](https://10x.gsa.gov/) phase 2 project.

We’ve synthesized outcomes from past 18F consulting engagements to highlight ways in which human-centered design methods can mitigate risks associated with centralizing IT services. We’ve analyzed real scenarios in which agency partners have attempted centralization, which didn’t always work out as planned. We’ve talked to users who understand how centralization has impacted their teams. We’ve collected many insights about how centralization can play out, and have distilled our learnings into this content series.

# Why this content matters
Hundreds of millions of dollars are spent on centralization efforts that don't end up delivering value to users. Many guides on centralization focus on IT as an ends not the means to achieve an agency’s mission. This often results in expensive vendor contracts that eventually get tossed out the window a few years later. We believe approaching centralization in a user-centered way reduces risks and improves outcomes for IT leaders, their employees, and the citizens they serve.

# Intended audience
Our intended audience is CIOs who set their agency’s modernization strategies as well as performance managers or anyone else who make decisions around IT centralization efforts within an agency. Our goal is to introduce this audience to user-centered exercises, methods, and other best practices to guide them through a centralization initiative.
