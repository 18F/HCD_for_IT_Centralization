Project overview
How might federal agencies design centralized IT services to produce value for teams rather than burden them? This question is at the heart of this 10x phase 2 project.

We’ve synthesized outcomes from past 18F consulting engagements to share ways in which human centered design methods can mitigate risks associated with centralizing IT services. We’ve analyzed real scenarios in which our clients have attempted centralization but they didn’t work out as hoped. We’ve talked to users who understand how centralization has impacted their day-to-day work. We’ve collected many insights about how this plays out, and we are sharing our learnings and best practices.


Why this content matters
Hundreds of millions of dollars are spent on centralization efforts that don't end up delivering value to users. Many guides on this topic focus on IT as an ends not the means to achieve an agency’s mission. This often results in expensive vendor contracts that eventually get tossed a few years later. We believe approaching centralization in a user-centered way reduces risks and improves outcomes for IT leaders, their employees, and the citizens they serve.
Intended audience
Our intended audience is CIOs who set their agency’s modernization strategies as well as performance managers or anyone else making decisions around IT centralization efforts within an agency. Our goal is to introduce this audience to exercises, methods, workshop formats, and other advice to guide them through the process. 


Content series
We’ve created a multi-part content series/guide that includes materials on the following: 
Defining IT centralization
Deciding whether or not to centralize 
Working with vendors to build a centralized solution
What happens after you centralize
Case study: Using HCD methods to evaluate IT centralization 
Publishing and promotion plan
We plan to publish the content series on the 18F blog and also make it accessible on the Github Repo for anyone interested in accessing the resources. We have interested partners (CIO Council, Performance.gov, Digital.gov, Centers of Excellence) who’ve agreed to cross-promote the content to help reach our intended audience.
