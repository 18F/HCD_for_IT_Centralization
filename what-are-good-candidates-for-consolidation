# 6. What are good candidates for consolidation? 

Now we want to get a better understanding of how current services can be restructured and possibly consolidated. This involves two separate activities: 

## Activity 1

Ask your team to sort the different services into one of three categories: 
Unique services: mission-specific services that aren’t candidates for consolidation
Possible to centralize: good candidates for consolidation in an ideal world with a trusted partner 
Difficult to centralize: services that seem like a good candidate but users actually feel would be a poor candidate for consolidation


## Activity 2
Ask your team to place their services on a graph with axes representing the value the service provides to users and the effort it takes to provide the service. 

High Value vs Low Value on the y-axis and High Effort vs Low Effort on the x-axis. 

This data will help you generate the top 5 potential “good candidates to consolidate” by taking all of the services in the “possible to consolidate” column and ranking them using [value] x [effort] and then selecting the top 5 in the list.

You can also generate the top 5 potential “bad candidates to consolidate” by taking all of the services in the “difficult to consolidate” column and ranking them using [value] x [effort] and then selecting the top 5 in the list.

Remember, this is an “ideal world” scenario
Remind the team to think about “possible to consolidate” candidates in an ideal world scenario. This is an important distinction of design thinking. Transport yourself to this world and think, what would success look like in an ideal world?
