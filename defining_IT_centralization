_This is the first in a series of posts discussing the importance of human centered design in IT centralization. As part of a 10x project, we've synthesized 18F's learnings from working with agency partners into a series of guides and best practices. The series explores how and why taking the time to prioritize users generates more success and overall happiness for an agency._

# Defining IT centralization

“IT centralization” and “shared services” are somewhat nebulous terms. Even after researching government IT centralization efforts, we had a hard time finding clear definitions for each. We've found it's helpful to level set on definitions before talking about strategy. To help, we talked with folks who’ve been through a centralization effort before. Here's what we learned. 

# IT centralization
IT centralization is a strategy for delivering IT services. These services are likely shared services across an organization. An IT centralization effort is the process of bringing separate IT services together. 
We worked with the Department of Justice (read more here) as they were evaluating IT centralization efforts. Before making a decision, first we wanted to understand how existing IT services were being used, how they could be improved, and where there might be opportunities for new or consolidated services. Using human centered design methods, we were able to investigate opportunities and risks at an early stage with the DOJ to mitigate potential risks down the road. 
Since there isn’t a one-size-fits-all method for IT centralization, it really depends on the agency’s needs and the people within the agency who will be affected by the centralization effort. 
Another methodology when centralizing is Technology Business Management (TBM). It’s designed to help CIOs and other leaders track IT spending and assess the value the IT services bring to the agency’s mission. GSA has created a TBM Playbook to help federal agencies align business needs with their IT strategy.
Shared services
Services are the tools or products used by agencies to deliver on their mission (for example, recruiting or email systems). Each program office in an agency may run their own independent version of a service (for example, program offices may have different email providers). 
Shared services are used across multiple parts of an organization. There are many ways to introduce shared services. One is expanding the use of an existing service (the email system one program office was using will now serve all offices). Another option is introducing new services that didn’t exist before (instead of using email for recruiting, all program offices use a new recruiting software). 
Some examples of shared services include:
G Suite (for centralizing emails, documents, and calendars) 
Cloud.gov (for centralizing cloud storage)
Login.gov (for centralizing identity verification)
An iterative process, not a waterfall approach
At 18F, we believe directly engaging users throughout an IT centralization process results in products that work better for the people they serve. This means less rework and fewer support issues down the road. An iterative process, not a waterfall approach, also decreases risk. Human centered design methods can help every step of the way.
Set yourself up for success
Many definitions of “shared services” only focus on two desired outcomes: reduced costs and increased efficiency. User needs aren’t always prioritized due to limited timelines, limited budgets, and competing agency pressures. But allowing for users to inform shifts in direction along the way is important. Finding a problem or changing direction after investing six months and $500,000 into the centralization effort sure beats discovering it five years and $100 million later.
Becoming your own service provider
When an agency decides to centralize a service, the central IT office becomes a service provider in a new way. The central office is now responsible rather than outsourcing the support to the program offices or an outside vendor. That’s why it’s so important to dive into the needs, concerns, and pain points of the people who will be affected by the service. It enables the agency to respond to and triage any issues that arise.
Owning more responsibility for technology services often requires agencies to train or hire more in-house product, technical, and design expertise. This can be a challenge, but it’s worth the extra effort. Ultimately, having these skills in-house will help ensure the agency delivers better digital services.
Next in our series, we’ll help you decide whether or not to centralize and what to consider when making this decision.
