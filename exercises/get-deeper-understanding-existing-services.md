# 4. Get a deeper understanding of existing services 

Now it’s time to capture the satisfaction levels for IT services already in use. Ask your team: 

- _What makes a good service offering?_ 
- _What can be improved?_

Have people rate each service as **satisfactory, unsatisfactory, or neutral** and also provide details on **pain points, positive attributes, and potential fixes.** This will give the team a chance to speak about where the agency is succeeding and where there’s room for improvement. This will also help you create a roadmap for prioritizing certain improvements.
