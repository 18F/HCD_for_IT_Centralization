# Guide: Human Centered Design Exercises for Centralization Projects

While it’s tempting to move quickly on a centralization initiative, it’s always worth it to invest in the time it takes to investigate opportunities and risks at an early stage. Digging into user research early in this process will mitigate much bigger risks down the line. 

## Do the important work upfront 

When partnering with agencies to understand how they might be impacted by potential IT consolidations, 18F’s first goal is to get a deeper understanding of how users engage with the current services. This includes how people are using existing IT services, how the services can be improved, and where there might be opportunities for new services. Working in this way allows organizations to: 

### Remove communication silos 
Communication silos are responsible for so much IT inefficiency and wasted resources. This is common for large organizations; when interdependent teams have little visibility into each other’s work, they duplicate efforts and overlook opportunities to build off each other’s work, share solutions, and work together. 

### Build trust by building collaborative relationships 
Building collaborative relationships needs to be at the foundation of any initiative sharing technology across teams—everyone needs to understand how to get what they need. There are many opportunities to increase efficiency and potentially reduce costs, but it must involve collaboration between those handling the IT centralization and the users. 

### Give users visibility into the issue resolution process
Giving users visibility into the work behind the scenes is another way to build trust without creating substantial burden on the agency. 

To help you get started on the right foot, we’ve gathered some exercises used at 18F to help agencies evaluate IT centralization efforts in order to mitigate risks and increase success: 

1. Facilitate a consensus-building workshop
2. Capture hopes and fears
3. Define the current state 
4. Get a deeper understanding of existing services 
5. Share an open-ended survey with a larger group of users 
6. What are good candidates for consolidation? 
7. Dig deeper into “good” and “bad” candidates
8. Define success metrics 

## Congrats! You did great work!
Taking the time to go through these exercises and deepen your understanding of the risks and opportunities involved can save you considerable time and money. The success of any centralization effort fundamentally depends on the value the centralization brings to its users. If a centralization introduces new obstacles, making work less effective and less efficient for users, it’s not bringing the agency value.
