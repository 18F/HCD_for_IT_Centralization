# 2. Capture hopes and fears 

Another useful exercise at the beginning of any project is Hopes and Fears. Bring your group of stakeholders together to share their hopes and magic-wand-wishes for the centralization effort as well as any fears, concerns, and questions. Write each hope or fear on a sticky note. A facilitator can cluster overlapping themes and ideas while moderating the discussion around the responses. 

This is a great way to level-set and begin to build trust with your teams. Be sure to document the responses (take notes, snap a photo of the whiteboard) and revisit these hopes and fears later when it comes time to build your roadmap. 

Just don’t get too attached to a detailed plan or set vision at the stage of that project. You will learn as you go and may need to adjust your plans along the way. If you’re working in an agile way, this is natural. As Graham Kenny writes, “strategic plans are less important than strategic planning”. https://hbr.org/2016/06/strategic-plans-are-less-important-than-strategic-planning
