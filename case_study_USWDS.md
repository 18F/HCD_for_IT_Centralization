# Building a centralized design system for the government: _A case study on U.S. Web Design System_

- **The challenge:** To create visual consistency across the nearly 30,000 U.S. federal websites in order to save the government considerable time and budget on design and development resources
- **The outcome:** [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) - a centralized tool that’s free and accessible for all federal agencies 
- **The impact:** Agencies save on resources (estimated savings: $100,000 per project that uses USWDS) and the American public has a much better experience interacting with consistent, easy-to-use government services 

Federal websites are the front door to government services. They’re often the first thing you encounter when interacting with the government. With nearly 30,000 U.S federal websites and almost no consistency between them, it was crucial to create a centralized system. This would allow agencies to build consistent, effective, easy-to-use digital experiences quickly and at a reduced cost.

Since USWDS launched in 2015, **over 180 government projects have adopted USWDS.** Pretty awesome, right? From the Department of Veterans’ Affairs to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, government teams are coming together to set a new bar for federal websites and prioritize user experiences thanks to this robust shared tool. We can estimate that agencies are saving around $100,000 per project on design and developer resources when using USWDS.

**Now consider a pre-USWDS world:** let’s say a young veteran named Joanne is applying for federal student loans. Joanne has to wade through multiple agency websites to access federal programs to help her afford college. But Joanne is overwhelmed by how hard these tools are to use, ultimately missing opportunities and feeling frustrated. The system that’s supposed to help her instead stood in her way. Creating consistency across federal systems helps people like Joanne access services they need and increases their trust in the government.

A team of designers and developers from 18F along with other agencies (Department of Education, U.S. Citizens and Immigration Services, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and USA.gov) went to work unifying a complex web of different interfaces, navigation tools, colors, fonts, and other visual identities with the goal of creating one centralized shared tool.

Here are some important lessons the USWDS team learned along the way: 

## 1. Empower your team
You’ll need a dedicated group to work on your centralization effort as well as support from leadership to give you the air cover required to do this work. It should be as important as any other project. 

Start by forming a multidisciplinary team. For many IT centralization efforts, this will mean bringing together expertise from IT, security, operations, and your developers. You’ll also want someone to fulfill the role of project manager and product owner to guide the project and prioritize the right goals. When you give people a stake in the system, they’ll feel invested to use the service and contribute back, increasing your chances of success in the end. 

## 2. Reinvent the experience, not the wheel
Find time for your team to gather together and answer two basic questions: 1) where are the problems? and 2) are these problems solvable? Find out if there are common needs and themes across different teams. Talk to people who will actually be using the centralized service or system and find out: what aspects of the service are required to do your job?

For the USWDS team, this meant coming together to build early consensus on 1) what already existed in the design inventory and 2) what the team wanted from a new system. Team members wrote down all the parts that already made up federal websites and brainstormed ideas for new features, clustering ideas on a wall and grouping them together to find common patterns. 

You may find that some of the simplest themes and patterns will come up again and again. Make sure you give people the opportunity to come together and build consensus early on.   

## 3. Look for duplication of efforts
Where is your team repeating efforts across different tools and services? Where are you wasting time? What takes the longest time or is the most challenging? Where does friction arise?
