_This is the third in a series of posts discussing the importance of human-centered design in IT centralization. As part of a [10x project](10x.gsa.gov), we've synthesized 18F's learnings from working with agency partners into a collection of best practices and guides. The series explores why taking the time to prioritize users is important, and how to incorporate collaborative methods into your process. In this post we’ll share some helpful tips on how to effectively work with vendors._

Let’s say the CIO of a large agency recently decided to consolidate different recruiting tools used across her agency’s different departments. We’ll call her Sandra. Previously each department was managing their own recruiting systems, processes, and data, but Sandra hoped the new arrangement would decrease the number of systems needed and reduce the burden on individual departments. 

Once the organization got through the initial roll-out, Sandra realized there were expectations of the central IT office she hadn’t foreseen. Now all the departments depended on this office to make sure the system worked. This didn’t just mean the system was up and running — the central IT team was also responsible for making sure the new system delivered on the promised value. 

Whenever something went wrong, the IT office got a call. Whenever users were confused about the new system, they went to the IT office with questions. Whenever users had ideas for how things could be better? Yes, you guessed it. They needed somewhere to go, and it became clear the central IT office was now a service provider. But what does this entail? 

After interviewing several folks who’ve experienced some sort of centralization effort, we’ve developed some helpful recommendations for navigating how to be an in-house IT service provider in a user-centered way: 
- Commit to continuous improvement
- Set up feedback loops to catch issues early  
- Communicate proactively to build user confidence 
- Give your users choice
- Deliver updates quickly with DevSecOps

Because at the end of the day, if your users are not benefiting from the centralization, the overall confusion and complexity might eat up the proposed cost savings.

# 1. Commit to continuous improvement 
You just made a big investment and your new centralized service is available to users. Now your focus needs to shift from delivery to follow-through. This is often referred to as Operations and Maintenance (O&M), but that sounds like the focus is just making sure things don’t break. In an agile world, delivering something to production is just the beginning. 
Now it’s time to shift from asking how do we make it happen to how do we make it even better?

Continuous improvement builds off the [modular contracting approach](https://18f.gsa.gov/2018/10/25/modular-contracting-and-working-in-the-open/). It recognizes that there’s always room to grow and it’s often more effective to make change in increments rather than accumulating large backlogs. This concept applies to staffing, software features, customer service requests, and bug reports.

# 2. Set up feedback loops to catch issues early  
Your centralized service won’t run itself — it needs to be actively managed to ensure the best return on investment. In order to make this shift, you may need to reshuffle roles and responsibilities on your team so they can respond to users in a timely fashion and stay on top of requests. And since needs change over time, you’ll want to stay in touch with your users. 

There are two things you can do to make the feedback loops more valuable: collect and analyze.  

## Collecting feedback
Setting up feedback loops doesn’t have to be hard. There are plenty of tools out there to help with this process. Here are just a few ways we’ve seen it done: 

- A well-monitored email inbox or support chat
- A project portal for users to share suggestions 
- A ticketing system
- Live feedback sessions (group sessions or interviews) with sticky notes
- Regularly scheduled [interviews](https://methods.18f.gov/discover/stakeholder-and-user-interviews/)
- Qualitative open-ended surveys (avoid “yes” or “no” questions)
- Retrospectives
- In-person observations to see how users interact with the service

## Analyzing feedback
Once you collect the data, it’s important to take some time to understand what it means. Look for themes across the data to help guide your next steps.

Here are four questions to ask while analyzing feedback: 

**1. Is your service more of a burden than a help?** Keep track of themes in requests as they come in. Catching themes (did you get eight requests for the same thing?) early gives you a chance to solve issues before they become big problems — or before your users give up and your new system goes unused.

2. Where is your service most helpful? Feedback doesn’t always have to be a bad thing. Asking questions about how your service is helping people can identify places to double down. It’s also good to keep an eye out for unexpected ways people are using your service. 

3. How healthy is your relationship with your users? The amount of time it takes your team to respond to bug reports and service requests is a good way to measure the health of this relationship. Keep in mind, it’s harder to regain your users’ trust than it is to build it from the beginning. 

4. How is your service delivering on your intended goals? Go back to the intended outcomes and success metrics you created in the beginning of the evaluation process to measure performance. 

Keep feedback channels open so there’s a shared mindset across the team for continuous sharing, continuous iterating, and continuous improvement. Receiving feedback is only the first part; make sure you respond to your users and communicate what you learned and what you’re doing as a result so users feel heard.
