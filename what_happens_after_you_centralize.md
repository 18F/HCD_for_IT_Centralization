_This is the fourth in a series of posts discussing the importance of human centered design in IT centralization. As part of a 10x project, we've synthesized 18F's learnings from working with agency partners into a series of guides and best practices. The series explores how and why taking the time to prioritize users generates more success and overall happiness for an agency._

Sandra, the CIO of a large agency, recently decided to consolidate different recruiting tools used across her agency’s different departments. Previously each department was managing their own recruiting systems, processes, and data. Sandra hoped the new arrangement would shrink the number of systems needed and reduce the burden on individual departments by managing one service all from her agency’s central IT office. 
However, once the organization got through the initial roll-out, Sandra realized there were expectations of the central IT office she hadn’t foreseen. Now all the departments depended on the central IT office to make sure the system worked. This didn’t just mean the system was up and running - the central IT team was also responsible for making sure the new system delivered on the promised value. 
Whenever something went wrong, the IT office got the call. Whenever users were confused on how new systems worked, everyone asked for training materials. Whenever users had ideas for how things could be better? You guessed it—they needed somewhere to go to air feedback. The central IT office was now a service provider. But what does that even mean?  

After interviewing several folks who’ve experienced some sort of centralization effort, we’ve developed some helpful recommendations for navigating how to be an in-house IT service provider in a user-centered way: 
- Commit to continuous improvement
- Set up feedback loops to catch issues early  
- Communicate proactively to build user confidence 
- Give your users choice
- Deliver updates quickly with DevSecOps
- Because at the end of the day, if your users are not benefiting from the centralization, the overall confusion and complexity might eat up the proposed cost savings.

# 1. Commit to continuous improvement 
You just made a big investment and your new centralized service is available to users. Now your focus needs to shift from delivery to follow-through. This is often referred to as Maintenance and Operation (M&O), but that sounds like the focus is just making sure things don’t break. In an agile world, delivering something to production is just the beginning. 
Now it’s time to shift from asking how do we make it happen? to how do we make it even better?
Continuous improvement builds off the modular contracting approach. It recognizes that there’s always room to grow and it’s often more effective to make change in increments rather than accumulating large backlogs. This concept applies to staffing, software features, customer service requests, and bug reports.
