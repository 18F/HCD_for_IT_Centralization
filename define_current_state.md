# Define the current state 

You’ll want to map out how things are working now. This will help you identify clear pain points and ensure that any changes you make will improve current processes, not block them. 

A good method for documenting this is to have your team write user-centered problem statements:

## A [user] who feels [negative feeling] about [reason] needs to [step to take] but faces [obstacle].

It may also be a good idea to run through the **5 Whys** if any particularly gnarly problems surface during the exercise. To do this, start with asking why the problem occurs. The answer to the first “why” should prompt the next “why” until you reach the root cause of the issue. 

## Try this exercise!
Grab a stack of sticky notes and pens, or if you’d rather run the exercise digitally, here’s a link to our Mural template, https://app.mural.co/t/gsa6/m/gsa6/1541449394363/ee9deba748ea698c0e4b831e157f5c5674af8a95 which will allow you to include remote staff in the conversation as well.
